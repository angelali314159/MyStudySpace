NOTE: In outputWindow.cpp on line 230, the FILE LOCATION MUST BE CHANGED TO BE CORRECT

The UI was programmed and run in Qt on a MacBook Air. We apologize if it is not great on other devices :(
    (download link for Qt: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)

All of the code should run properly just running the main.cpp file. All included files in GitHub are required.
